# Overview

This project was a chance for me to test the waters of the Erlang language and try using it in a fun way.

for my project I used Erlang to create a game based off the variation of rock paper scissors, rock paper scissors spock lizard.

This project was meant to give me a chance to use the Erlang language in a fun way to learn more about it.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
